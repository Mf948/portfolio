# portfolio
Welcome to my Website it was built using HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap.
 I Made this Project to develop mmy understanding of grids from Bootstrap
 on the index.html I made the use of bootstrap navbar and jumbotron.
jumbotron was used to make a center box where the text and images lay.
 i used the grid system to make sure that the jumbotron would take 7 spaces of the 12 that is allowed to take, on small screens the grid system works in a way that it takes advantange of the full screen
 text and images are responsive to the size of the screen.
>I linked fonts from outside sources like google fonts. 
>the portfolio.html i made the use of rows and collumns to make sure two images fit in the same screen when the size of a screen is large and when the size of a screen is small that the images would take the whole screen.
>the contact.html I made the use of bootstrap forms to make the contact form and sumit button.
